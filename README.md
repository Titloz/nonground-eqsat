# nonground-eqsat
An implementation of equality saturation able to handle non-ground terms!
The branch nongroundcc contains a working (but unoptimized) version of the algorithm described by H. Leidinger and C. Weidenbach in their paper Non-ground congruence closure, for a small toy language containing only symbols of arity at most one.
